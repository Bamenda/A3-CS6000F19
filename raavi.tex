I am, Manohar Raavi, pursuing PhD in Engineering(Security). My major goal on taking CS6000 course is to improve my research skills. 
I am confident that the course is well designed and would make me a better researcher by the end of the semester.
 I did my Undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Jawaharlal Technological University Kakinada and Masters degree in Telecommunications Management from Oklahoma State University. I worked as a Network Engineer at Oklahoma State University for almost 2 years. I like to spend most of my free time in Rec Center.
 I love to learn and play new games all the time. I play Badminton, Volleyball, Cricket, Table Tennis, Racquetball, Chess, Carrom Board etc.

Hi Raavi, whats your favorite game?, Rodger

Hi Rodger, It's a tough one to choose between Badminton, Volleyball and Cricket. If I have to pick one, I would say Badminton.
