I am currently in the Ph.D. in Security program at UCCS, with a focus in embedded systems security as it relates to the Experimental Physics \& Industrial Control System (EPICS). I am a firm believer in constant self-improvement through reading and communication while I have a penchant for music as well as poetry. My goal for this class is to become adept at the computer science research process.
